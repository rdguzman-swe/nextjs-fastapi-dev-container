## ✨ Features

- ⚡️ Fast tooling via `Bun` and `uv`
- 🧠 Linting with `ESLint` and `ruff`
- 🎨 Formatting with `Prettier` and `ruff`
- 🔍 Static type checking with `TypeScript` and `ty`
- 🪝 Automatic checks via `pre-commit` hooks
- 🛠️ Simple developer workflow via `Makefile`
- 🐳 Docker-in-Docker support
- 🔁 Persistent shell history across container rebuilds

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🚨 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `Docker`
- `VS Code` with the "Dev Containers" extension

> **Note:** This dev container is made specifically for `VS Code`, but it should work with any IDE that has a "Dev Containers" plugin.

### 📦 Setup

1.  Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rdguzman-swe/fastapi-nextjs-dev-container.git <your-project>
```

2. Open in `VS Code`

```bash
code <your-project>
```

3. Reopen in container
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`
   - Select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

4. Initialize project

```bash
make init
```

This will scaffold the backend and frontend and install all dependencies.

5. Edit `frontend/` and `backend/` files as needed

| `make init`        | Full setup (scaffold + install)                |
| `make scaffold`    | Create backend & frontend if missing           |
| `make frontend`    | Run Next.js dev server (http://localhost:3000) |
| `make backend`     | Run FastAPI server (http://localhost:8000)     |
| `make post-create` | Re-run container setup script                  |
